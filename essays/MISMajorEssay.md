The reason that I chose to pursue MIS as a major is because of the scope of career options that it unlocks when used in combination with my current major in accounting. Accounting often works hand in hand with MIS during many different types of audits or accounting fields. One particular type of audit that I would like to work on in the future are information technology audits that review the controls of organizations' computer systems in order to ensure that the companysâ€™ financials are being organized in a secure and reliable source. I also would like to understand more how browser web pages and computer apps and programs operate so that I can apply this information in my own daily personal life.
