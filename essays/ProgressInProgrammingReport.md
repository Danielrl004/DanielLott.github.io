<strong>1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: </strong>
<br>
After completing assignment 1, I found that my ability to understand the flow of data and the use of functions has greatly improved. When I first started working on this assignment, I found that my understanding of functions and their uses weren’t where it needed to be, so taking my time to comment out all of my previously used functions, such as the isNonNegInt function really helped me to understand how the data is being processed to produce our desired results. Also, when creating the server, I was very confused at first on what needed to be processed on the client side vs the server side and how that data was going to be pulled to create the invoice. Going through the previous class labs, exercises, and additional tutorials and practices from other coding websites, I was able to gain a better understanding of how the form from my product_display.html page was being processed using app.post and then redirecting the user to the respective web page depending if errors were found in the users’ product quantity inputs. Once I was able to understand this, I was able to identify where and how to input my codes in order to complete my individual requirement.

<strong>
2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</strong>
<br>
Though I have improved a lot from this first assignment, I still believe that I need to work on my understanding of server side processing. Understanding the code, and being able to write a new code from scratch to complete different tasks are two completely different things. For this first assignment, I relied on our previously completed exercises and labs heavily to get through it, so I wasn’t able to completely write all the codes myself. I feel that I am close to being able to, but I still need to get more comfortable with the server side concepts. 
<br>
<strong>
3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</strong>
<br>
I do believe that the WODs have helped me learn more as it forced me to understand the tasks that need to be completed. It has helped my problem solving ability and to be more detail oriented. This is because when I first attempted to do a WOD, I wasn’t reading the instructions line by line or word by word, rather I was mainly focused on achieving the end product which caused me to overlook important details. Of course, when I attempted to run my server, the webpage didn’t load as expected. This helped me to shape my understanding of coding as coding is very detail oriented, and that things won’t work properly if steps are overlooked. Although some of the details may not have appeared as significant on my first impression, I learned that understanding their functionality in respect to how it cooperates with other functions is. WODs have also helped me to practice my application of different codes and transfer my knowledge gained during class time to experience.

<strong>
4. The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</strong>
<br>
Labs have helped me to learn but I wouldn’t say that I would be able to complete them with confidence. Coding is still very new to me, and though I have gotten better at it, I am not 100% confident in my coding abilities. These labs took me a very long time to complete, and often I had to reach out to other students for help to complete them. 
<br>
<strong>
5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</strong>
<br>
I believe that I did learn a lot from assignment 1 and though I still have many things to improve in, I feel that this experience helped me to be able to problem solve and figure out a solution. I may not feel very ready to work on assignment 2 but I believe that using the same problem solving strategy as I learned in assignment 1 will help me get through it. 
<br>
<strong>
6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</strong>
<br>
I feel that while we are going over the labs in class, the pace is too fast and that it doesn’t allow us time to actually fill out the lab and answer the lab while we are going through it. Once I start writing down an answer for a question, we are already moving on to the next exercise and I often find myself falling behind. If we were given 30 seconds to 1 minute after we complete a step or question so that we could fill out the lab as we go, I feel that I would be able to keep up with what the professor is teaching, instead of playing catch up and not understanding the whole time. This causes me to need to spend much more time to complete these labs as I still need to review and gain a better understanding of what we did in class. I also now need research and watch more tutorials at home to answer the questions that I missed during class. Also, because I am answering them to the best of my knowledge, I am not entirely sure if my answers to the questions and my understanding of the concepts are correct. 
<br>
My second suggestion is to implement in class group exercises so that we would be able to work together to practice our problem solving and coding skills. Working individually is very difficult as once you get stuck, there isn’t any second opinion to help you through it, so working in groups could benefit the class by allowing us to also learn from each other.

<strong>
7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</strong>
<br>
One on one help is always the best source of help as it gives me immediate feedback and is able to help me with problems that I am currently stuck on. If the teacher or TA is unavailable, then working with classmates and reviewing the screencasts/readings are the second best thing. This is because the course material is able to help us gain a general understanding of the concepts while working with classmates allows us to apply our knowledge to help others or receive help if needed.
