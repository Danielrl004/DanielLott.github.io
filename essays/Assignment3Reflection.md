<p>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</p>
I decided to create a bike store. I have always liked riding so I thought it would be a fun topic to do for this assignment. When the user first loads onto my index page they will be able to choose what item page they want to look at. I put a navigation bar that stays on each page to make it easy to get to other item pages. My store items range from helmets, jerseys, and bikes. Once the user has chosen their items they will need to sign in before they can check out. They also have the option to register if they don’t have an account. I created the page to be personalized, the user will see their name displayed on each page they visit and it also shows how many time they have visited the website before. 
<p>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</p>
The most notable shortcoming was not getting the my IR to work. I had planned to complete my IR after I got all the other parts working. My IR was harder than expected and I wasn't able to implement it to fully work. The second notable thing was update user. I was close with Assignment 2 getting it to work so I thought I would have time to implemented into my Assignment 3 but unfortunately my IR stopped me from getting to the update user.
<p>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</p>
I think what I am most proud of about my website would be how fast I was able to put together the sessions and cookies. I felt like this was my strong suit for this assignment.  I am also proud of my website as a whole. Overall this class pushed me to be a proficient coder. I am able to debug and understand the language clearer. 
<p>Describe what you are least happy with your system</p> 
I am not actually sure of what I am least happy with about my system. Everything works well and the design is nice. I am actually pretty happy with all the things that I implemented into my system. There wasn’t one thing that stood out to me as a something I was not content with. 
<p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</p>
When developing my assignment 3 verse assignment 2 I believe that this assignment was a bit easier. I understood the cookies and session pretty fast and assignment 2 helped me get more practice with debugging so when I ran into issues with this assignment I was able to find the causes without help. I would say a bigger difference was creating the cart page, but overall the validation for the cart was taken from assignment 2 and slightly modified. 
<p>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</p>
The way I would address any issues when I was doing my assignment 3 is going onto Youtube, stackoverflow, and I would also collaborate with peers. Watching Youtube and getting examples from different videos helped me to figure out how to construct the code so that it would work. Stackoverflow was helpful when needing to create different functions that I needed and how gave examples of how I might want to set up the function. 
<p>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</p>
Things that worked well in this assignment was the session and cookies, I was able to set that up fairly quickly. The CSS changes that I made to my website was something that worked well. My Assignment 2 user interface was a bit overwhelming so for this designed I kept it more sleek instead of artsy. 
<p>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</p>
A few things that did not work well in this assignment was converting everything to sessions and cookies. I was able to understand how I could set it up but actually applying the session and cookies to my website was a bit hard. 
<p>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</p>
Some things I learned in this assignment was how to create sessions and cookies and how they work. After doing some research I was able to understand these concepts and apply it to my code. I also learned more about CSS and how to configure the look of my website. I was able to understand how to manipulate the text boxes so that they would be in the shape I wanted it to be. 
<p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</p>
If I could go back in time and do things differently it would be to start on my IR sooner. I spent a lot of time making sure everything was working and my plan was to implement my IR after I got the system running normally. But this IR was quite tricky and took a lot of extra time then I had planned for it. 
<p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</p>
I spent about 20% thinking about how to do something. Writing code was about 40% and testing and debugging would be 40%. Overall I think the way my time was split worked really well. I was able to think about what I wanted to do and not spend too much time on how I might do it, since Assignment 2 gave me a lot of practice. Debugging and testing did take some time though which is why I gave it 40%.
<p>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</p>
For this assignment I did not work with a partner.
